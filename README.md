<h1>Turtle Crossing</h1>
A turtle has to cross a road (similar to Frogger) coded in python as brought to me inside udemy course "100 Days of Python".

<h2>Game Control</h2>
Up-arrow moves turtle up. There is no way back!

<h2>Rules</h2>
Whenever the turtle reaches the other side of the road, level and game speed increase.
The turtle restarts its way from the bottom.
When a car hits the tutle, the player loses.
